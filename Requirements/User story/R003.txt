##Business requirements##
###1-line summary###
Add Timer event for system to tell when it needs to wrap up a Scenario/challenge/plot
###Description###
Currently the application does not have Timer event, and the system does not know when a time limit has been reached.
###Business Value###
having this allows the system to create a challenge that forces the players to complete a game task within that time or face the consequence. 
This will allow the players to further immerse in the game environment 
and add sense of urgency during text generation for the story as a whole.

###User story###
As a system
when I create a time limited challenge
I want the system to create a timer event for the challenge
so that the system can pass or fail the challenge depending on the player's action game time total

###Acceptance criteria###
Given a player is at chat view
When the game time attribute has been updated
And the challenge has not been completed
Then the system will check if the game time attribute exceeded the timer event time limit
And the narration will take the result as input during text generation
