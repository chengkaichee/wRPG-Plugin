# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-add-character-class/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

-   **UI Component**: A dropdown component will be added to the `CharacterSelect.tsx` view. This component will be built using the Radix UI Select component.
-   **State Management**: The `Character` schema in `lib/schemas.ts` will be updated to include a `class` property of type `z.enum([...])`. The `initialState` in `lib/state.ts` will also be updated.
-   **Prompt Engineering**: The `generateProtagonistPrompt` in `lib/prompts.ts` will be modified to include the selected class in the prompt sent to the LLM.

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Use a simple HTML `<select>` element.
-   Pros: Simple to implement.
-   Cons: Does not match the existing UI style.

**Option B:** Use the Radix UI Select component. (Selected)
-   Pros: Consistent with the existing UI style, provides more flexibility for styling.
-   Cons: Slightly more complex to implement than a standard `<select>` element.

**Rationale:** Option B is selected to maintain a consistent and high-quality user experience.

## External Dependencies

-   No new external dependencies are required.
