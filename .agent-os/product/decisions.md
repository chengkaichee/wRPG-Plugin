# Decisions

## Technology Stack

The technology stack was chosen to be as close as possible to the original Waidrin app. The original app uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This fork uses the same technologies to ensure compatibility and to make it easier to merge changes from the original app.

## Plugin-Based Architecture

The plugin-based architecture was chosen to make it easy to extend the game with new rules and mechanics. This will allow the community to create their own plugins and share them with others.
