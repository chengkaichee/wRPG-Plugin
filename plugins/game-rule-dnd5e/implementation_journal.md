### 2025-09-08: Removed unused import `narratePrompt` from `src/main.tsx`.

**Reasoning:** The `narratePrompt` function was imported but not utilized within the `main.tsx` file. Removing unused imports helps maintain code cleanliness and reduces potential for confusion.

**Outcome:** The import statement `import { narratePrompt } from "@/lib/prompts";` was removed. TypeScript type checks and project builds completed successfully after the change, confirming no regressions were introduced.
