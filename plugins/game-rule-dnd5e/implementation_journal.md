**Task:** Rebuild plugins and main application.

**Outcome:**
- `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin rebuilt successfully.
- `test-ui-plugin` rebuilt successfully.
- Main application build initially failed with `TypeError: Cannot find name 'getActiveGameRuleLogic'.` in `lib/prompts.ts`.
- **Fix:** Added `import { getActiveGameRuleLogic } from "./engine";` to `lib/prompts.ts`.
- Main application rebuilt successfully after the fix.

### 2025-09-09

**Task:** Refresh dependency to use next 15.4.7 per package.json.

**Outcome:**
- Ran `npm install` to update dependencies.
- Main application rebuilt successfully after dependency update.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with combat mechanics refinement as outlined in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/Combat mechanics change request.md`.

## Refactoring game-rule-dnd5e prompt logic (2025-09-11)

**Status**: Completed and Verified

**Summary of Work:**
- Identified all prompt generation logic within `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/main.tsx`.
- Created corresponding functions in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/pluginPrompt.ts` for each identified prompt generation logic (including `getLocationChangePrompt` and `getCombatantsPrompt`).
- Moved the prompt generation logic from `main.tsx` to the newly created functions in `pluginPrompt.ts`.
- Updated `main.tsx` to call these new functions in `pluginPrompt.ts` and updated import statements.
- Successfully built both the plugin and the main application.

**Verification Results:**
- All manual acceptance scenarios (Prompt Logic Execution, `main.tsx` Content Review, Prompt Manipulation in `main.tsx`) were verified by the user and are working as expected.
- No changes in the content or behavior of generated prompts were observed, confirming FR-003.

**Conclusion:** The refactoring was successful and the feature is implemented as per the specification.

### Date: September 14, 2025

**Task:** Resolve `TypeError: Cannot add property` for `combatLog` in `main.tsx`

**Resolution:**
- The issue was manually resolved by the human user.
- The `combatLog.push()` operations in `handleConsequence` were replaced with `combatLog = [...combatLog, newElement]` to ensure immutability is handled correctly.

**Current Status:**
- `main.tsx` changes for `combatLog` immutability are applied.
- Proceeding with post-execution verification.

### Date: September 17, 2025

**Task:** Implement T005: Internal state management for Prompt Testing section in `StateDebugger.tsx`.

**Outcome:**
- Added `useState` hooks for `narrationPrompt`, `setNarrationPrompt`, `narrationOutput`, `setNarrationOutput`, `narrationIsLoading`, `setNarrationIsLoading`, `narrationError`, and `setNarrationError` in `components/StateDebugger.StateDebugger.tsx`.
- Removed incorrect `useAppBackend` import and related `isLoading`, `error` destructuring.
- TypeScript type check passed successfully.

**Conclusion:** T005 is completed.

### Date: September 17, 2025

**Task:** Implement T006: Implement `handlePromptChange` function to update `narrationPrompt` on textarea change.

**Outcome:**
- Implemented `handlePromptChange` function to update `narrationPrompt` state on textarea change.
- Added `useEffect` hook to initialize `narrationPrompt` from `state.lastNarrationContext.lastPrompt` when the editor expands.
- Connected `handlePromptChange` to the `onChange` event of the "Prompt Used" textarea.
- TypeScript type check passed successfully.

**Conclusion:** T006 is completed.

### Date: September 22, 2025

**Task:** Refactor Initiative Mechanism (Combat Phase 2)

**Outcome:**
- Refactored the `handleConsequence` function in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/main.tsx` to correctly calculate initiative rolls, assign `isFriendly` status, identify involved combatants, and manage the `plotType`.
- Created a new test file `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/initiative.test.tsx` with placeholder tests for the initiative mechanism.
- Pending test implementation and verification.

# Implementation Journal: Refactor Initiative Mechanism (Combat Phase 2)

## Date: 2025-09-24

### Summary
This work refactored the combat initiative system within the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin. The core logic in `main.tsx` and `pluginData.ts` was updated to correctly calculate initiative, determine combatant allegiance, and manage the game's plot state during combat.

### Changes Made
1.  **Corrected Dice Roller Import**: Fixed a critical bug in `pluginData.ts` by changing the `rpg-dice-roller` import from `import type` to a standard `import`. This ensures the library is available at runtime, resolving the `TypeError: rpgDiceRoller.DiceRoll is not a constructor` error.
2.  **Refactored Initiative Logic**: The `handleConsequence` function in `main.tsx` was updated to use the `rpg-dice-roller` library to calculate initiative rolls (`1d20` + Dexterity modifier) for all combatants.
3.  **Improved Combatant Identification**: Logic was enhanced to more accurately identify friendly and enemy combatants based on the narration context that triggers combat.
4.  **Robust State Management**: The `plotType` is now reliably set to `combat` when initiative is triggered and reverts to `general` when combat ends.
5.  **Test Verification**: The Jest test suite in `initiative.test.tsx` was corrected and used to verify all the above changes. The tests now pass, confirming the new implementation is working as expected.

### Outcome
The initiative system is now functional and robust. All changes are contained within the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin, and all related tests are passing.
