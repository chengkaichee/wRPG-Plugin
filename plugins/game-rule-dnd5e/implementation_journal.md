## Refactoring game-rule-dnd5e prompt logic (2025-09-11)

**Status**: Completed and Verified

**Summary of Work:**
- Identified all prompt generation logic within `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/main.tsx`.
- Created corresponding functions in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/pluginPrompt.ts` for each identified prompt generation logic (including `getLocationChangePrompt` and `getCombatantsPrompt`).
- Moved the prompt generation logic from `main.tsx` to the newly created functions in `pluginPrompt.ts`.
- Updated `main.tsx` to call these new functions in `pluginPrompt.ts` and updated import statements.
- Successfully built both the plugin and the main application.

**Verification Results:**
- All manual acceptance scenarios (Prompt Logic Execution, `main.tsx` Content Review, Prompt Manipulation in `main.tsx`) were verified by the user and are working as expected.
- No changes in the content or behavior of generated prompts were observed, confirming FR-003.

**Conclusion:** The refactoring was successful and the feature is implemented as per the specification.

### Date: September 14, 2025

**Task:** Resolve `TypeError: Cannot add property` for `combatLog` in `main.tsx`

**Resolution:**
- The issue was manually resolved by the human user.
- The `combatLog.push()` operations in `handleConsequence` were replaced with `combatLog = [...combatLog, newElement]` to ensure immutability is handled correctly.

**Current Status:**
- `main.tsx` changes for `combatLog` immutability are applied.
- Proceeding with post-execution verification.
