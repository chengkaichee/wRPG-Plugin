### 2025-09-05 - Irrelevant LLM Responses Fix

**Objective:** Address the issue of `getActionChecks` being called with empty narration, leading to irrelevant LLM responses.

**Problem:** In the initial game loop, `getActionChecks` in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/main.tsx` was called with an empty `sceneNarrationForChecks` because `lib/engine.ts`'s `narrate` function couldn't find a previous narration event. This resulted in the LLM generating out-of-context action checks.

**Solution:** Modified the `narrate` function in `lib/engine.ts`. Added a conditional check (`if (sceneNarrationForChecks && gameRuleLogic.getActionChecks)`) to ensure that `gameRuleLogic.getActionChecks` is only called if `sceneNarrationForChecks` is not empty.

**Outcome:**
- Prevents `getActionChecks` from being called with an empty narration string.
- Ensures LLM calls for action checks are made only with relevant context.
- Improves narrative coherence and LLM API efficiency.

**Verification:**
- TypeScript type check passed successfully.
- `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin rebuilt successfully.
- Main application rebuilt successfully.

**Next Steps:** Await user confirmation of the fix by running the application and providing console logs.
