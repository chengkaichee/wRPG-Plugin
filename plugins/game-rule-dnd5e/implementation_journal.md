### 2025-09-02 - Combat Mechanics Refinement Completed

**Objective:** Implement the refined combat mechanics as outlined in `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/Combat mechanics change request.md`.

**Outcome:** All planned modifications for combat mechanics refinement have been implemented:
- `lib/schemas.ts`: `isCombat` removed.
- `lib/state.ts`: `isCombat` removed from `initialState`.
- `lib/engine.ts`: Reliance on `isCombat` removed; `getNarrativeGuidance` and `generateActionsPrompt` are always called.
- `lib/prompts.ts`: `generateActionsPrompt` calls `gameRuleLogic.getActions()` if available.
- `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/pluginData.ts`: `PlotType` enum, `CombatantSchema`, `BattleSchema` defined; `plotType` and `encounter` added to `DnDStatsSchema`.
- `plugins/game-rule-dnd5e/src/main.tsx`: `getNarrativeGuidance`, `resolveCheck`, `handleConsequence`, and `getActions` methods implemented and interact with the plugin's internal `plotType` and `encounter` state.

All changes have been verified through code review and appear to be correctly implemented.

**Next Steps:** Await further instructions from the user.
