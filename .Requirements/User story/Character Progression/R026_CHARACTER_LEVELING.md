*R026_CHARACTER_LEVELING*

##Business requirements##
###1-line summary###
Implement character leveling, including XP tracking and level-up events.
###Description###
The system should track a character's accumulated experience points and trigger a level-up event when the XP total reaches a predefined threshold. This event should then allow for the application of new class features, HP gains, and proficiency bonus updates.
###Business Value###
Provides a structured progression system for characters, rewarding players for their adventures and unlocking new abilities and power.

###User story###
As a Player
when my character earns experience points
I want the system to track their progress towards the next level and notify me when they level up
so that I can see my character grow in power and unlock new abilities.

###Acceptance criteria###
Given a character has accumulated XP
When the XP total meets or exceeds the requirement for the next level
Then the character's level increases.
And the system prompts the player to apply level-up benefits (e.g., HP gain, new features).

Scenario 1: Gaining enough XP to reach Level 2
Given a 1st-level character with 0 XP
When they gain 300 XP (reaching the 300 XP threshold for Level 2)
Then the character's level becomes 2.
And the system indicates that the character has leveled up.
