##Business requirements##
###1-line summary###
Add Game time tracking mechanics
###Description###
Currently the application does not have Game Time tracking, so the narration feels seems to go on for too long when it is trying to create a sense of urgency.
###Business Value###
having this allows the players to use the Rest mechanics. 
also allows further immerse in the game environment
and allow for delay consequence of choices during text generation for the story as a whole.

###User story###
As a player
when I pick or enter an action
I want the system to advance game time based on the action and game situation
so that the system can include game time impact in the prompting and text generation
And the player can use long / short rest game mechanics

###Acceptance criteria###
Given a player is at chat view
When an action is selected or entered
Then the system will prompt LLM to determine how much game time has passed
And update the game time attribute
And the narration will take the new time as input during text generation
