In Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, DC stands for Difficulty Class. It's a target number that a player must meet or exceed with an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll to succeed at a task. The higher the DC, the harder the task.

While there isn't a strictly defined list for every increment (like DC 1, DC 2, DC 3, etc.), the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) and Player's Handbook (PHB) provide guidelines for common DCs and what they represent. Here's a breakdown of the generally accepted DC tiers, their definitions, and examples:

DC 0 (Automatic Success / Trivial)

Definition: A task that is so simple it doesn't even require a roll. There's no real chance of failure unless an external factor interferes.
Example: Opening an unlocked and unjammed door. Picking up a dropped coin. Taking a step forward.
DC 1-4 (Very Easy / Trivial but Possible Failure)

Definition: A task that almost anyone could succeed at with minimal effort, but a truly unlucky roll (a natural 1) might still lead to failure. Often used for basic actions where time isn't a factor.
Example:
DC 1: Remembering a very common historical fact.
DC 3: Recognizing a common animal from a distance.
DC 4: Keeping your balance on a wide, flat beam.

DC 5 (Very Easy)
Definition: A task that is very simple, and most characters with even a minimal bonus in the relevant ability can succeed without issue.
Example:
Recalling common knowledge about a local village.
Climbing a knotted rope.
Spotting a large, obvious trap.
Following a very clear trail.

DC 10 (Easy)
Definition: A task that requires a bit of effort or focus but is generally achievable for someone with some training or natural aptitude. This is a very common default DC.
Example:
Persuading a guard to let you pass with a plausible story.
Jumping across a 10-foot gap.
Picking a simple lock.
Disarming a basic, visible trap.
Tracking a single creature through soft mud.
Remembering details about a regional deity.

DC 15 (Medium)
Definition: A task that presents a noticeable challenge, requiring a character to be competent in the relevant skill or to get lucky. This is the typical DC for moderate challenges.
Example:
Convincing a reluctant merchant to give you a discount.
Climbing a rough, crumbling wall.
Picking a complex lock.
Spotting a well-hidden tripwire in a dark hallway.
Identifying a rare monster from its tracks.
Recalling obscure lore about an ancient artifact.

DC 20 (Hard)
Definition: A task that is difficult and requires significant skill, specific training, or excellent luck. Only characters proficient in the relevant skill will consistently succeed.
Example:
Calming a panicked crowd during a riot.
Leaping over a deep chasm.
Picking a masterwork lock.
Disarming a complex, magical trap.
Tracking a ghost through a bustling city street.
Identifying a rare magical disease.

DC 25 (Very Hard)
Definition: A task that is exceptionally challenging, often requiring highly specialized skill, extraordinary effort, or powerful magic. Even proficient characters will struggle.
Example:
Intimidating a powerful noble or king.
Breaking free from adamantine manacles.
Crafting a legendary magic item without proper tools.
Deactivating a powerful arcane ward.
Recalling the exact wording of a forgotten prophecy.

DC 30 (Nearly Impossible / Legendary)
Definition: A task that is incredibly difficult, bordering on the impossible without epic abilities, extreme preparation, or divine intervention. Success implies a truly heroic feat.
Example:
Persuading a high-ranking devil to betray its master.
Single-handedly holding up a collapsing cavern roof.
Picking a lock on a vault designed by a demigod.
Disarming a trap that would devastate a small town.
Reconstructing the true history of a long-lost civilization from fragments.

Key Considerations for DMs:
Context Matters: The same action can have different DCs depending on the circumstances. (e.g., swimming in calm water vs. swimming in a stormy sea).
Player Creativity: Reward clever solutions. A good plan might lower the DC, or even negate the need for a roll entirely.
Consequences of Failure: Failure should be interesting, not just a dead end. What happens if they fail the check?
Proficiency and Expertise: Characters with proficiency in a skill add their proficiency bonus. Characters with Expertise double their proficiency bonus, making higher DCs more achievable for them.
