## Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition: Classes and Subclasses (PHB, DMG, XGtE)

### 1. Barbarian

**Class Overview:** Primal warriors fueled by rage. They have the highest hit die (d12), making them incredibly durable. Their Rage feature grants damage resistance and bonus damage, making them excellent front-line tanks and damage dealers.

* **General Benefits:** High HP, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while raging (most common damage types), advantage on Strength checks and saving throws while raging, Reckless Attack for consistent damage, extra movement speed.
* **General Drawbacks:** Cannot cast or concentrate on spells while raging, limited utility outside of combat (especially with mental stats often being a dump stat), typically reliant on melee attacks.

**Subclasses (Primal Path):**

* **Path of the Berserker (PHB):** Embraces pure, unadulterated fury.
    * **Specific Benefits:**
        * **Frenzy (3rd level):** While raging, you can make one additional melee weapon attack as a bonus action each turn. This provides excellent sustained damage.

        * **Intimidating Presence (10th level):** Use an action to frighten a creature with your menacing aura.
        * **Retaliation (14th level):** When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
    * **Specific Drawbacks:**
        * **Frenzy's Exhaustion:** The significant drawback is that when your Frenzy rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion. Exhaustion is harsh (disadvantage on ability checks, half speed, disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws, etc.), making sustained Frenzy difficult without ample short/long rests.
        * Less utility than other subclasses; very combat-focused.

* **Path of the Totem Warrior (PHB):** Channels the spirits of animals to gain varied resistances and abilities.
    * **Specific Benefits:**
        * **Spirit Seeker (3rd level):** Cast *beast sense* and *speak with animals* as rituals.
        * **Totem Spirit (3rd level):** Choose a totem (Bear, Eagle, Wolf) for unique rage benefits.

Wolf provides advantage on melee attack rolls for allies within 5 feet.
        * **Aspect of the Beast (6th level):** Choose another animal (Bear for carrying capacity, Eagle for vision, Wolf for tracking/stealth).
        * **Spirit Walker (10th level):** Cast *commune with nature* as a ritual.
        * **Totemic Attunement (14th level):** Choose another animal (Bear for damaging targets that hit you, Eagle for flight, Wolf for knocking prone).

        * Requires careful selection of totems to maximize synergy.

        * Less direct damage than Berserker, but superior defense and utility.
