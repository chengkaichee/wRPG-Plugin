# **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition: Experience Systems and Awarding**

In D\&D 5th Edition, the experience system is **universal across all classes**. All characters, regardless of their class, follow the same advancement table and earn Experience Points (XP) from the same sources. The **Dungeon Master (DM)** is responsible for awarding XP.

## **1\. Experience Point (XP) Tracking (Traditional Method)**

This method involves tracking numerical XP characters earn for overcoming challenges.

**A. Character Advancement Table (Universal for All Classes):**

Your character's **total character level** (including multiclassing) is determined by their accumulated XP:

| XP Total | Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | 1 | \+2 |
| 300 | 2 | \+2 |
| 900 | 3 | \+2 |
| 2,700 | 4 | \+2 |
| 6,500 | 5 | \+3 |
| 14,000 | 6 | \+3 |
| 23,000 | 7 | \+3 |
| 34,000 | 8 | \+3 |
| 48,000 | 9 | \+4 |
| 64,000 | 10 | \+4 |
| 85,000 | 11 | \+4 |
| 100,000 | 12 | \+4 |
| 120,000 | 13 | \+5 |
| 140,000 | 14 | \+5 |
| 165,000 | 15 | \+5 |
| 195,000 | 16 | \+5 |
| 225,000 | 17 | \+6 |
| 265,000 | 18 | \+6 |
| 305,000 | 19 | \+6 |
| 355,000 | 20 | \+6 |

**B. Awarding XP Guidelines:**

1. **Defeating Monsters:**  
   * Each monster has an XP value based on its Challenge Rating (CR).  
   * When monsters are defeated (killed, captured, or driven off), the **total raw XP value** of the monsters is divided **equally** among all participating characters.  
   * *Example:* Party of four defeats monsters totaling 300 XP. Each character gets 75 XP.  
2. **Overcoming Non-Combat Challenges:**  
   * DMs are encouraged to award XP for successfully navigating exploration, social interactions, puzzles, or traps.  
   * The DM assigns an XP value to the challenge **as if it were a monster of a certain Challenge Rating** (e.g., an "easy" social encounter might be worth XP equivalent to an easy combat encounter for the party).  
   * This XP is also typically divided equally among participating characters.  
3. **Bonus XP:**  
   * Optional: DMs may award small bonus XP for exceptional roleplaying, clever tactics, or creative solutions, at their discretion.

## **2\. Milestone Advancement (Narrative-Based Method)**

This alternative method allows DMs to level up characters based on story progression, without tracking numerical XP.

* **How it Works:** The DM designates specific "milestones" in the campaign (e.g., completing a major quest, reaching a new location, defeating a key villain). When a milestone is achieved, the DM simply announces that the characters gain a level.  
* **Benefits:**  
  * **Simplicity:** Reduces bookkeeping for everyone.  
  * **Story Focus:** Encourages players to pursue narrative goals.  
  * **Party Cohesion:** Ensures all party members are always at the same level.  
  * **DM Control:** Allows precise control over campaign pacing.  
* **Drawbacks:**  
  * Less transparent for players who prefer to see numerical progress.  
  * May lack the immediate gratification of earning XP after each challenge.

## **When a Character Levels Up**

Regardless of the XP system, when a character gains a level, they:

* Increase their **Hit Point Maximum**.  
* May increase their **Proficiency Bonus**.  
* Gain new **class features**, spell slots, or other improvements specified by their class.  
* At specific levels (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 19th), they usually gain an **Ability Score Improvement (ASI)** or can choose a Feat (if allowed).
