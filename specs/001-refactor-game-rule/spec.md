# Feature Specification: Refactor game-rule-dnd5e prompt logic

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-game-rule`  
**Created**: Wednesday, September 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "refactor game-rule-dnd5e to move prompt logic from main.tsx into pluginPrompt.ts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a plugin developer, I want the prompt generation logic for the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin to be centralized in `pluginPrompt.ts` so that `main.tsx` is cleaner and easier to maintain, and prompt logic is more reusable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin is loaded, **When** a prompt is generated (e.g., for protagonist creation or narrative guidance), **Then** the prompt logic should be executed from `pluginPrompt.ts` and the correct prompt returned.
2. **Given** the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin's `main.tsx` file, **When** I review its content, **Then** I should see that all prompt generation logics have been removed and replaced with calls to `pluginPrompt.ts`.
3. **Given** a function in `pluginPrompt.ts` returns a prompt, **When** `main.tsx` receives this prompt, **Then** `main.tsx` can manipulate the prompt variables as needed, and `pluginPrompt.ts` should not have knowledge of these subsequent manipulations.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if `pluginPrompt.ts` is missing or has errors? (This is an implementation detail, but the system should handle errors gracefully).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin MUST centralize all prompt generation logic within `pluginPrompt.ts`, ensuring no actual prompt generation logic remain in `main.tsx`.
- **FR-002**: The `main.tsx` file of the `game-rule-dnd5e` plugin MUST call functions from `pluginPrompt.ts` for all prompt generation.
- **FR-003**: The refactoring MUST not alter the content or behavior of the generated prompts.
- **FR-004**: Functions within `pluginPrompt.ts` MUST return prompt objects only.
